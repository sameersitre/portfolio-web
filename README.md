This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in what you need — every variable is
optional and the app degrades to bundled static content without them.

| Variable               | Scope                  | Effect when unset                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` | server, runtime        | Skips the `POST /api/v2/portfolio/content` fetch and renders `lib/content/*` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`         | server, runtime        | Falls back to `lib/github/mock.ts`                                           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`    | client, **build time** | Analytics disabled                                                           |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is inlined into the client bundle, so it must be present during
`next build` — the Dockerfile takes it as `--build-arg`. The other two are read at
request time and are supplied as container `environment:` entries.

`BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL` is set for the deployed container by the `portfolio` service
in `trovie/infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` (`http://backend:8000`); it is deliberately
**not** a build arg, because the compose network doesn't exist during `docker build`.
As a result `/` is prerendered with static fallback content at build time and picks up
live backend data on the first ISR revalidation (`revalidate = 300` in `app/page.tsx`).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
